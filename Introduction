This guide will help you have an overview of Cloud Computing (based on the definitions in NIST-Cloud Computing) and Openstack
so that you can deploy Openstack in the proper way with sufficient features for the purpose of experience and learning.

The project is deployed on the LAB environment (VMware Workstation), on a single host which has the support of 
virtualization technology x86. In the "Heat and Passion" version of this project, i sourced the docs of Openstack and Google
so i would not cite the links here. In the scripts, i made some modifications to simplify the command lines and explanations as well.

According to the Openstack docs, if we use Neutron for Networking, the standard model will have 3 nodes (Controller,Compute,Network).
Since some of you do not have enough resources to deploy, others want to join developing some projects or research the options
for configurations so i decided to sum up this tutorial over a single node (a single host).

There are 6 basic services in this version of tutorial including: KEYSTONE, GLANCE, NOVA, NEUTRON, CINDER and HORIZON. 
In the next versions, i will complement the other services after successful testing. 

In the scripts, i made the backup-s of original configurations. I also used the commands of string manipulation, permission, 
variable declaration, etc. to implement the configuration of Openstack. You can reference into each scripts to get more details.
